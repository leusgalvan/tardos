False

Let m1, m2 be men and w1, w2 be women with the following preferences list:

m1 -> [w1, w2]
m2 -> [w2, w1]
w1 -> [m2, m1]
w2 -> [m1, m2]

We have two possible matches:

M1 = [(m1, w1), (m2, w2)]
M2 = [(m1, w2), (m2, w1)]

In M1, neither woman gets her preferred man. In M2, neither man gets his preferred woman.
