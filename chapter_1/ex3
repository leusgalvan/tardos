No, there is not always a stable pair of schedules.

Consider a network A with shows of ratings 20 and 30 and a network B with shows of ratings 25 and 35.
For simplicity assume that a show is represented purely by its rating.
We have two slots to fill, and each network can fill it in two differente ways, i.e. it has two possible schedules.
Therefore, there are four possible pairs of schedules. Lets show that each one of them has an instability.

Attempt 1:

Time slot  A   B
   0       20  25
   1       30  35

Here A is losing both slots. However, by swapping shows (putting 20 in slot 1 and 30 in slot 0), it wins the first slot,
so there is an instability.

Attempt 2:

Time slot  A   B
   0       30  25
   1       20  35

Here B is losing the first slot and winning the second one. However, by swapping shows, it can win both.

Attempt 3:

Time slot  A   B
   0       20  35
   1       30  25

Here B is winning the first slot and losing the second one. However, by swapping shows, it can win both.

Attempt 4:

Time slot  A   B
   0       30  35
   1       20  25

Here A is losing both slots. However, by swapping shows, it can win the second slot.
