To find top ords we need to choose nodes with no incoming edges.

I'll use indentation to indicate which node is selected at each iteration.
First iteration is not indented, second is 1-space indented, third is 2-space
indented and so on.

a
-b
--d
---c
----e
-----f
---e
----c
-----f
--c
---d
----e
-----f
-d
--e
---b
----c
-----f
--b
---c
----e
-----f
---e
----c
-----f

Therefore we have the following 6 orderings:

abdcef
abdecf
abcdef
adebcf
adbcef
adbecf
